# Public editorial lineage

> Append-only editorial history for the public book repository. This file records publication/editorial state only. It does not reproduce the private scientific lineage or runtime artifacts.

## 2026-09-28 — Public repository initialized

Repository:
`minhtri22/Inside-ArcLLM`

Purpose:
- publish only author-approved book material;
- keep the ArcLLM research/source repository private;
- prevent runtime source code, raw artifacts, private branches, internal research records, or implementation-only material from leaking into the book repository.

Publication boundary:

```text
private research source-of-truth
        ↓ editorial review
author-approved book content
        ↓
Inside-ArcLLM public repository
```

Initial public set:
- Lời nói đầu — AUTHOR APPROVED;
- Chương 1 — AUTHOR APPROVED v0.3;
- Chương 2 — AUTHOR APPROVED with GGUF-expansion condition applied;
- Chương 3 — AUTHOR APPROVED with contract/term-reminder conditions applied;
- Chương 4 — AUTHOR APPROVED;
- Chương 5 — AUTHOR APPROVED with governance/runtime separation condition applied.

Not published at initialization:
- Chapter 6 draft;
- runtime source code;
- raw scientific artifacts;
- private scientific lineage;
- private QA/runtime packages;
- research branches or commit history from the private repository.

## Editorial rules carried into the public book

1. Start from zero; no coding prerequisite.
2. Technical English terms receive a short Vietnamese meaning reminder when needed to preserve reading flow.
3. Scientific PASS/FAIL, implementation/execution, governance, and infrastructure must not be conflated.
4. A governance artifact such as `lineage.md` must be labeled as governance and not implied to participate in runtime execution.
5. Research-management modes are introduced only when the chronology actually requires them.
6. New chapters are published only after explicit author approval.
